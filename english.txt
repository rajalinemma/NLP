Oooh
Just can't believe this man
(Metro Boomin want some more nigga)
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you, I just kept it to myself
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
But baby keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me? (touch you better than me?)
Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep?)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me
Ooh
Woah, woah, woah
21
Had me crushing, I was cuffing like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link
Got you ridin round in all types of benz's and rovers
Girl you used to ride in a rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliante (on God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (on God)
You was rocking coach bags, got you chanaynay
Side bitch in frisco, I call her my bae bae (21)
I got a girl but I still feel alone
If you playing me that mean my home aint home
Having nightmares of going through your phone (21)
Can't even record you got me out my zone
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know
If you creeping just don't let me find out (on God)
Get a hotel never bring him to the house (on God)
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playing on my patience
Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will
(I might)
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I did it all for love (love)
I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (love)
I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ass tonight)
Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)
Not the best idea (idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
I just killed my ex (my ex)
I still love him, though (I do)
Rather be in Hell than alone
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails, cherry red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I did not wanna leave you, baby
I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours, yeah
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing, yeah
I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
Oh, I
I did not wanna leave you
I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers (oh)
Write my name in the sand (mmh)
Talk to myself for hours (yeah)
Say things you don't understand (never will)
I can take myself dancing, yeah

Yeah, I can love me better than
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell"
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot

And when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers

Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at
Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome, so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doin' something unholy
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone

But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you

And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh)
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine
Fallin' like I did?
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh)
Get up, get up
Kiddominant on the beat, better run it back
Fuckin' Robitussin
I don't know why this shit got me lazy right now, yeah
Can't do Percocets or Molly
I'm turnin' one, tryna live it up here right, right, right
Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place
You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight speaks to me
I can make it hurricane on it
Hunnid bands, make it rain on it
Tie it up, put a chain on it
Make you tattoo my name on it, oh
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video, yeah
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place
You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight speaks to me
Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around

We've been swingin' and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin'
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we've been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this but we're caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
For the record, shit
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I'd rather ride it out for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we've been together
Something 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this but we're caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?
I was lost
You found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness
You always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love
'Cause you don't be giving up
And it's crazy
How you saved me
Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for
So, thank God
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God

But you did and you do, and he knew

Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Who made a change to everything
From my heart to my last name
Hey, hard to tell
When he fell
That boy was Heaven sent
And every night
When I close my eyes
Before I say amen
I thank God
I get to wake up by your side

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all

And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart (ooh)
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mm, you got me feeling like

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow (woo)
I need more time but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life), yeah
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy (oh)
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Whoa
Na, na-na
More than life
Oh
So if I can't get close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
But I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Man, we could be superstars
We been ridin', wreckin' cars (ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure time is up
And so we fell in love with spinnin' drops
Still only a child, but faithful error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like fuck this glitter
Skeet off dirt, I'm ditchin'
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that rockin' with you?
I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business
And spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', he ain't never step or help
With none of these killings, you doin' a lot of cappin'
Watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of the witness
Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars (superstars)
Remember when we was jackin' cars (jackin' cars)
Now it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on a bitch
When I slide, night light on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga you shitted
I knew the Perc was fake, but I still ate it
'Cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, cutthroat business, KTV, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get live, all you niggas gon' die
Time rollin', bustin' on my opponent
No half-steppin', I'm crunchin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages to stages to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate
When they gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck-nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty inch carbons
We could've been superstars (superstars)
Remember when we was jackin' cars (jackin' cars)
Now it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars

Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (now your time is up)
And so we fell in love with spinnin' drops
Still only a child, but faithful error
I ain't slimin', I'm grimin'
Any way you put it I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek
Sniper Gang, trust

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight

With dark skin, looking at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, coming over to me, yeah
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away, but
I want someone who love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothing but love on my mind (my mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down to marry"
Like, tell me, "That's life" when I'm stressing at night
Be like, "You'll be okay", and, "Everything's all right, " uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away, but
I want someone who love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
I want (I) someone to love me
I need (I) someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
Rats along his back (we were getting ready)
When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)
Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)
And feasts on your screams (thunder!)
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano's on his way)
Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (a seven-foot frame, rats along his back)
In doing so, he floods my brain
Married in a hurricane
He's here!
Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)
Not a word about Bruno!
I never should've brought up Bruno!

We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on (hey)

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Love
Love will keep us together
Think of me babe, whenever
Some sweet-talking girl comes along, singing her song
Don't mess around, you've just got to be strong, just stop
'Cause I really love you, stop
I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
You
You belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those girl start hanging around talking me down
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound, just stop (stop)
'Cause I really love you, stop (stop)
I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Whatever
Young and beautiful
But someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turning you on?
I will, I will, I will
I will be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before and I'll say it again while others pretend
I need you now and I'll need you then, just stop (stop)
'Cause I really love you, stop (stop)
I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Whatever, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will
You better stop
'Cause I really love you, stop (stop)
I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Whatever, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will

Billy Ray was the preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered 'round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was, ooh, yes, he was
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me "Everything is alright"
He'd kiss and tell me "Everything is alright"
Can I get away again tonight?
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was, ooh, Lord knows, he was (yes, he was)
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was, oh, yes, he was
He was the sweet-talkin' son of a preacher man
(The only boy who could ever teach me)
I kissed me the son of a preacher man
(The only one who could ever move me)
The sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man
(The only one who could ever groove me)

When evening falls so hard

I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water

Sail on by
Your time has come to shine

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
